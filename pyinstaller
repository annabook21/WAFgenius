pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed my_app.py

Step 4: Displaying Results

The results of the analysis can be displayed in various ways:

	•	Directly in the main window, using widgets like Label or Text for text results, or Canvas for graphs.
	•	In a new window, which can be created dynamically to show the results after analysis.
	•	Exported to a file, with an option in the GUI to open or explore the file location.

Step 5: Packaging the Application

For distribution, you might want to package your application as a standalone executable for Windows. Tools like PyInstaller can freeze your Python application and all its dependencies into a single executable:

pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed my_app.py

Replace my_app.py with the name of your script. The --windowed option prevents a command-line window from opening when your GUI application is run.

This approach allows you to create a user-friendly, classic Windows application from your Python script, making it accessible to users who are not comfortable with command-line interfaces.
